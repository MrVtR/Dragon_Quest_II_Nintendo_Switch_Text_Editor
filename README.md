# Dragon_Quest_II_Nintendo_Switch_Text_Editor
Repository that contains the code for edit text from stringDataEn.bin and stringMapEn.bin files from DQ II - Nintendo Switch Version (Tested only on StringDataEn.bin from DQ II yet), probably it'll work on DQ I and DQ III with some minor adjustment, I'll work on those two games too
